# MH2 Armor Set Searcher

## About

This is an armor set searcher for the game Monster Hunter Dos.
Join the [MH Old School Discord](https://discord.gg/YzmeXb8) for an active community around the game.

The vast majority of the codebase is simply copied from the Monster Hunter Tri ASS I made a while ago. You can find that [here](https://github.com/TimH96/mhtri-armor-set-searcher), please refer to the README of that project for further information, instructions and known issues. Ideally I would have a more robust way of sharing code between these two projects, but given that this works it might just be one of those TODO's that never actually gets done.

The data was provided by platypete and their [MH2 Wiki](https://mh1g-wiki.herokuapp.com/mh2/), kudos goes out to them.
